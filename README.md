# Docker Hands-on materials

## Nov 7-8, 2015

These are the materials for [a Docker hands-on
workshop](http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/2015-11-09-docker.html)
that we ran at UC Davis in November 2015.

----

1. [An introduction to running Docker on Linux](./docker-intro.rst)

   Here is an introduction to running Docker on an Ubuntu machine.  For
   sanity's sake, we use an Amazon Web Services machine, but it should work
   on any reasonably recent Ubuntu machine (14.04 or greater install).

2. [Challenge exercises](./challenge-exercises.rst)

   For people that want to try some things out on their own, here are some
   suggestions for getting started.
