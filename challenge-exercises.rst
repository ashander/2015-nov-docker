Some "challenge exercises"
==========================

Here are some ideas for projects that are a little less scripted than
`the introduction to Docker on Linux <./docker-intro.rst>`__.

1. Install Docker on your local computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux) and
   run through the introduction yourself.

2. Make a Docker container for a command-line package that you use.

3. Create a Docker Hub account and push the Docker container you built
   to the hub.  Try running it on someone else's computer (or on
   another/new AWS machine).

* Take a look at `mybinder.org <http://mybinder.org>`__, which takes a
  git repo and turns it into a running data analysis environment.

* Try out `docker-machine
